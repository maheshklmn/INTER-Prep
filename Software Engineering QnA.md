### **1. What is Software Engineering?**

* The **systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach** to software development, operation, and maintenance.
* Goal: build reliable, efficient, and maintainable software.

---

### **2. What is the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?**

* A step-by-step process to develop software.
* **Phases:** Requirement → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.

---

### **3. What are the different SDLC models?**

* **Waterfall Model** – Sequential flow.
* **Spiral Model** – Risk analysis + iteration.
* **V-Model** – Verification & validation.
* **Agile Model** – Iterative & incremental (Scrum, Kanban).
* **Iterative Model** – Repeated development cycles.

### **4. What is the difference between Verification and Validation?**

| Term         | Meaning                            | Example                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Verification | “Are we building it right?”        | Code review, design check        |
| Validation   | “Are we building the right thing?” | User testing, acceptance testing |

---

### **5. What are Functional and Non-functional requirements?**

* **Functional:** Describe system behavior (login, report generation).
* **Non-functional:** Define system quality (performance, security, reliability).

---

### **6. What is Software Testing? Types?**

* Process of finding errors in software.
* **Types:** Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance, Regression, Smoke, Stress.

---

### **7. What are the differences between Black Box and White Box testing?**

| Type      | Tester Knowledge      | Focus                    |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Black Box | No internal knowledge | Input-output behavior    |
| White Box | Internal code known   | Logic, paths, conditions |

---

### **8. What is Software Maintenance? Types?**

* Process of modifying software after deployment.
* **Types:**

  * Corrective (fix bugs)
  * Adaptive (new environment)
  * Perfective (enhancements)
  * Preventive (future-proofing)

---

### **9. What are Software Quality Attributes?**

* **Reliability, Maintainability, Efficiency, Usability, Portability, Security.**

---

### **10. What is Software Configuration Management (SCM)?**

* Systematic control of software changes.
* Tracks versions using tools like **Git, SVN**.
* Components: **Version control, change control, build management.**

## ⚙️ **Top 3 Scenario-Based Software Engineering Questions (Short Answers)**

---

### **Scenario 1:**

**Q:** The client reports a bug after product delivery. How do you handle it?
**A:**

1. Log the bug in the defect tracking system.
2. Analyze cause (requirement, design, code, or environment).
3. Apply **corrective maintenance**.
4. Test & release a patch (regression testing included).

---

### **Scenario 2:**

**Q:** The project is delayed due to changing client requirements. What process model is most suitable?
**A:**

* **Agile Model** or **Spiral Model** – allows iterative development and flexibility.
* Frequent feedback helps adapt to changing needs quickly.

---

### **Scenario 3:**

**Q:** After integration, one module crashes the system. What testing phase was weak?
**A:**

* **Integration testing** phase.
* Fix by adding more **interface and interaction tests** between modules.
