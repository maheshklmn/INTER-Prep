### **3. Difference between TCP and UDP?**

| Feature     | TCP                 | UDP            |
| ----------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| Type        | Connection-oriented | Connectionless |
| Reliability | Reliable (ACKs)     | Unreliable     |
| Speed       | Slower              | Faster         |
| Use         | HTTP, FTP           | DNS, Streaming |

### **4. What is IP addressing?**

* Logical address for identifying a device in a network.
* **IPv4:** 32-bit (e.g., 192.168.0.1)
* **IPv6:** 128-bit (e.g., 2001:db8::1)

### **5. What is the difference between Hub, Switch, and Router?**

| Device | Layer     | Function                     |
| ------ | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| Hub    | Physical  | Broadcasts data to all ports |
| Switch | Data Link | Forwards based on MAC        |
| Router | Network   | Forwards based on IP         |

### **6. What is DNS?**

* **Domain Name System**: Converts domain names → IP addresses.
* Hierarchical and distributed naming system.

---

### **7. What is ARP and RARP?**

* **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** IP → MAC.
* **RARP (Reverse ARP):** MAC → IP.

---

### **8. What is the difference between circuit switching and packet switching?**

| Type         | Circuit        | Packet       |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------ |
| Connection   | Dedicated path | Dynamic path |
| Resource Use | Fixed          | Efficient    |
| Example      | Telephone      | Internet     |

### **9. What is congestion control?**

* Regulates data flow to prevent network overload.
* Example algorithms: TCP Tahoe, Reno, AIMD.

---

### **10. What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?**

* **HTTP:** Data sent in plain text.
* **HTTPS:** Secured using SSL/TLS encryption.

## ⚙️ **Top 3 Scenario-Based Questions (Short Answers)**

### **Scenario 1:**

**Q:** Two systems on the same network can’t communicate, though both have IPs.
**A:**

* Check subnet mask mismatch.
* Verify ARP table and gateway configuration.
* Ensure no firewall or duplicate IP conflict.

---

### **Scenario 2:**

**Q:** You can ping by IP but not by domain name.
**A:**

* DNS issue.
* Check DNS server configuration or use alternate DNS.

---

### **Scenario 3:**

**Q:** High latency and packet drops occur in data transfer.
**A:**

* Possible congestion or faulty router/switch link.
* Use `traceroute` or `ping` to locate delay.
* Apply congestion control or QoS mechanisms.
